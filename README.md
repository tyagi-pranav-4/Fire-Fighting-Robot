🔥 Fire-Fighting Robot (IoT Project)
🚀 Overview

The Fire-Fighting Robot is an IoT-based safety system designed to detect fire automatically, send real-time alerts, and extinguish fire using a water pump or extinguisher module.
It uses sensors, a microcontroller, and motor drivers to move autonomously toward the fire source.

🎯 Features

🔥 Automatic fire detection using Flame/Temperature sensor

🤖 Autonomous movement toward the fire source

💧 Automatic extinguisher activation (water pump/CO₂ spray)

📡 IoT Connectivity (Blynk/MQTT) for real-time monitoring

🔔 Alerts on mobile when fire is detected

🟢 Manual control mode using mobile app or remote

🔋 Low-power, compact, and easy to deploy

🛠️ Hardware Used

Arduino UNO / NodeMCU / ESP32

Flame Sensor

DHT11 / Temperature Sensor

Motor Driver (L298N)

DC Motors + Chassis

Water Pump / Extinguisher Module

Buzzer & LEDs

Jumper Wires, Battery

⚙️ Working Principle

Sensors continuously monitor for fire or high temperature.

When fire is detected:

Robot moves toward the flame

Water pump turns ON to extinguish it

Buzzer alerts

IoT app sends notification to the user

User can also control the robot manually through the IoT dashboard.

📲 IoT Integration

You can integrate with:

Blynk – Real-time dashboard

MQTT – Cloud communication

Firebase – Database of alerts

Provides:

Fire alerts

Robot movement control

Pump ON/OFF control
